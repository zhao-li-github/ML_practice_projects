Jupyter notebooks of the practice projects from courses I took and Kaggle competitions. My solutions may not be optimal, and I am keeping improving!

Current Progress:

1. Finding donors (Udacity, Done)
2. Imaging classifier (Udacity, Done)
3. Customer segments (Udacity, Done)
4. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle, in progress)
